Within the tutorial, you'll build a small Instagram clone.

The tutorial's content is divided into the following sections:

* [Setting up the Project](project-setup.mdx) - helps you set up the environment for the rest of the tutorial.
* [Components and Props](first-components.md) - learn the basic Litho building blocks, write a simple *Component*, extend it to accept *props*, and become familiar with building layouts with Flexbox in Litho.
* [Adding State](adding-state.md) - teaches you how to make your Components interactive.
* [Handling Events](handling-events.md) - provides you with an overview of how to handle events in Litho.
* [Building Lists](building-lists.md) - gives an overview of how to build lists in Litho with the Sections API.

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can, even if it’s just one or two sections.


**Note:** Before you dive into the tutorial, we highly recommend you watch this short video on how Litho functions and how a Litho component gets turned into a View on the screen:
