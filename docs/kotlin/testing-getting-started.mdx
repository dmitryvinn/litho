The **Kotlin Litho Testing API** is presented through the `LithoViewRule` class. It allows you to:
- make assertions against the component hierarchy,
- mark assertions against the view hierarchy,
- and gives access to utility functions to interact with the view hierarchy, e.g. by clicking

`LithoViewRule` uses `Junit TestRule` which provides a flexible mechanism to execute code before and after a test method, as a result of which, we are able to prepare the environment and then clean it up after test, so you don't have to worry about it.

If you would like to read more about the TestRules, please [visit the official JUnit documentation.](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/rules/TestRule.html)

### Adding Dependencies

In order to use Kotlin Litho Testing API you'll need to add the `litho-testing` dependency into your BUCK file:

```python title="BUCK"
deps = [
    "//fbandroid/libraries/components/litho-testing/src/main/java/com/facebook/litho/testing:testing"
],
```

### Basics

In order to use the @Rule inside of your test class you need to initialise it:

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

Then, within a test, you will generally render your component with the help of the `LithoViewRule.render(Component)` method and perform assertions or other actions on the `LithoView` returned by the `render` call.

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=start_render_example end=end_render_example
```

In the next Sections we will describe how to use well known `Assertions` and how to interact with your `Components`.
