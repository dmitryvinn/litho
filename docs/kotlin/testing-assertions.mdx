It is possible to use `AssertJ-style` APIs to assert what gets rendered by a `Component` or `LithoView`.
All of the `Component` and `LithoView` assertions are exposed in `LithoAssertions.assertThat()` methods.
If you need to get a handle of a component that is inside of the ComponentTree of the one you rendered using `LithoViewRule`,
you can use the `findComponent()` method.

For all of the examples below let's use this `TestComponent`, that has one direct child: `InnerComponent`, and one non-direct child: `Text`
```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=test_component_start end=test_component_end
```

## Assertions against the component hierarchy
There are two main use-cases when it comes to the component hierarchy assertion:

### 1. How to assert my component directly renders a certain component
If you want to find out only the **direct** children, which for our `TestComponent` will be `InnerComponent`, you can use `findDirectComponent(Class<out Component?>)`:
```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=find_direct_component_start end=find_direct_component_end
```

### 2. How to assert my component renders a certain component somewhere in its children

If you want to find a component that is not a direct child of your component or the hierarchy level is not important for your test, you can use `findComponent(Class<out Component?>)`:

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=find_non_direct_component_start end=find_non_direct_component_end
```

If you would like just to confirm if given component classes were rendered, but you don't need a component instances itself, you can use `LithoAssertions.assertThat(lithoViewRule.lithoView).containsComponent()` or `LithoAssertions.assertThat(lithoViewRule.lithoView).containsExactly()`
```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=contains_components_start end=contains_components_end
```
You can use `containsComponent()` `hasExactly()` providing different parameters such as number of times the component class should be present in the component tree or the varargs of all of the classes you would like to check, you can as well check if the view doesn't contain given class by using `doesNotContainComponents()`:
- `containsComponent(KClass<? extends Component>)`
- `hasExactly(int, KClass<? extends Component>)`
- `containsExactlyOne(KClass<? extends Component>)`
- `doesNotContainComponents(KClass<? extends Component>...)`


### Props checking

It is possible to check if your component has needed Props. Here is a simple example of how to achieve that:

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=has_props_start end=has_props_end
```


## Assertions against the view hierarchy

`LithoViewRule.render(Component)` returns a `LithoView` which can be used for assertions that can be found in [LithoViewAssert](https://staticdocs.thefacebook.com/litho/javadoc/com/facebook/litho/testing/assertj/LithoViewAssert.html) class.
Thanks to that we can for example check if given text or drawable is visible, or if the view contains given test key.

```kotlin file=litho-core-kotlin/src/test/kotlin/com/facebook/litho/examples/LithoViewRuleExampleTest.kt start=lithoview_assertion_start end=lithoview_assertion_end
```

Some of the popular assertions:
- `hasContentDescription(String)`
- `hasVisibleDrawable(@DrawableRes int)`
- `hasVisibleDrawable(Drawable)`
- `doesNotHaveVisibleDrawable(@DrawableRes int)`
- `doesNotHaveVisibleDrawable(Drawable)`
- `hasVisibleText(String)`
- `hasVisibleText(@StringRes int)`
- `doesNotHaveVisibleText(@StringRes int)`
- `hasVisibleTextMatching(String)`
- `hasMeasuredHeightOf(int)`




:::note
*Row* and *Column* are not `KComponents`, they are just made to look like it, but `Assertions` and `hasProps` won't work on them.
