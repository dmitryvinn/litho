:::note
**Definition**: *Hooks* are stateful functions that can persist data across renders and perform side effects. They may only be called from `render()` and other hooks.
:::

Hooks allow components to remain a single render function, with behavior added by composition rather than inheritance. The API is heavily inspired by [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

### Example

```kotlin {3}
class MyComponent : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val clicks = useState { 0 }
    return Text(
        style = Style.onClick { clicks.update { c -> c + 1 } },
        text = "Clicks: ${clicks.value}")
  }
}
```

In the above code, `useState` is a hook which can keep track of a variable across renders. The first time it's called it'll return the initial value (`0`), but subsequent calls will return the current value of the state.

Most of the APIs implemented with lifecycle methods in the Java Specs API, e.g. `@OnCreateInitialState` and `@OnAttached`, have hooks equivalents in the Kotlin API.

## Rules for Hooks

Hooks maintain state by using the identity of the current component along with the sequence of the call within the component. This means that in a render, the first `useState` call will maintain one piece of state, a second `useState` call will maintain another, etc, and they'll be consistent across render passes.

As such, there are **three hooks rules** that you need to remember:
 1. Hooks can only be called from `render()` or from another hook.
 2. Hook cannot be called conditionally: that means they cannot be called from within conditionals (if/for/while/...), or called **after** an "early exit" check (e.g. `if (...) return null`).
 3. Hook names should start with `use`

The reasons for rules 1 and 2 are to preserve hook identity as mentioned above. Rule 3 is just to make it easier to tell when a function has hook-like behavior.

It will be helpful to look at some examples, starting with the most fundamental hook, `useState`!
