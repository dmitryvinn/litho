## Rows and Columns, Revisited

As in the Spec API, `Row` and `Column` are the primary layout containers used in the KComponent API. If you need a refresher on them, check out the main [layout docs](/docs/mainconcepts/uicomposition/flexbox-yoga).

### Differences from the Spec API

If you're used to the Spec way of writing containers, there are a few important differences when using `Row` and `Column` in the KComponent API:
1. **Props of Rows and Columns**: Props that configure the `Row`/`Column` itself, like `alignItems` or `justifyContent`, now appear as props directly on the container Component. In this way, there is no difference from setting props on any other component.
2. **Common Props**: Props that configure a particular child's positioning within the context of a `Row`/`Column`, like `alignSelf` or `flex`, now appear with other [common props](/docs/kotlin/kotlin-api-basics#common-props) on the `Style` passed to that child. You can think of this as akin to `LayoutParams` in vanilla Android - they must be able to go on any component and are read by the parent.
3. **Children**: Children are added within a trailing lambda using the `child()` call.

You can see this in practice in the following code:

 ```kotlin
  Column(style = Style.padding(all = 8.dp), alignItems = YogaAlign.CENTER) {
    child(Text(style = Style.flex(grow = 1f), text = "Foo"))
    child(Text(text = "Bar"))
  }
 ```

## Migrating from the Spec API

:::note
#### Why are Layout Props Defined in Two Different Ways Now?

Without code-generated builders, we've had to make a distinction between props of the container itself and common props that can be set on children of the container.

For example, `alignItems` configures the default alignment for children in this container and is only valid on a flexbox container. It's set like a normal component prop on `Row`/`Column`.

On the other hand, `alignSelf` can be respected on any child of a container, whether it's a Text, a Switch, or some custom Component: it's therefore exposed as a common prop via `Style`.

The benefit of this is that we can now statically verify all required props are set instead of verifying at runtime (as well as not rely on codegen!).

### Flexbox Properties Cheatsheet

Following is a table to help you tell, at a glance, whether to set a layout property directly on the `Row`/`Column` or on `Style`:

| Flexbox Property | Configures a Specific Child? | Example KComponent Usage |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `alignContent` | No | `Row(alignContent = YogaAlign.CENTER)` |
| `alignItems` | No | `Row(alignItems = YogaAlign.CENTER)` |
| `alignSelf` | Yes | `Style.alignSelf(YogaAlign.CENTER)` |
| `height` | Yes | `Style.height(50.dp)` |
| `flexBasis` | Yes | `Style.flex(basis = 8.dp)` |
| `flexGrow` | Yes | `Style.flex(grow = 1f)` |
| `flexShrink` | Yes | `Style.flex(shrink = 1f)` |
| `justifyContent` | No | `Row(justifyContent = YogaJustify.CENTER)` |
| `margin` | Yes | `Style.margin(8.dp)` |
| `padding` | Yes | `Style.padding(8.dp)` |
| `width` | Yes | `Style.width(50.dp)` |
| `wrap` | No | `Row(wrap = YogaWrap.NO_WRAP)` |

Notice that a property is set via `Style` if and only if it configures a specific child!

### Example Migration

Below is an example of a simple `Component` using various layout properties, converted to an equivalent KComponent:

<Tabs
  groupId="flexbox"
  defaultValue="kotlin_flexbox"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin_flexbox'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java_flexbox'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin_flexbox">

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/FlexboxComponent.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java_flexbox">

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/java/onboarding/JavaApiComponentSpec.java start=start_example end=end_example
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
