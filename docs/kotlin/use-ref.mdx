The `useRef` hook allows a component to maintain a mutable reference that doesn't trigger a re-render when updated.

It returns an instance of `Ref` which has a single mutable `value` property which should only be read/written on the UI thread. `useRef` can be used as a replacement for [lazy state](/docs/mainconcepts/coordinate-state-actions/state-overview#lazy-state-updates) from the Spec API, though it has more uses beyond that.

## Managing UI Thread State with `useRef`

:::note
**Ref.value should only be read/written from the main thread.** Since there is no guarantee that a Component's render function is executed on the main thread, it should not be accessed during the execution of render.

Some locations where it *is* safe to access and mutate `Ref.value`:
- `onClick` and other View events
- `onVisible` and other visibility events
- `useEffect` and its cleanup lambda
:::

Appropriate usecases of `useRef` are best shown by example. Note that none of these examples read or write `useRef` off the main thread or during the execution of the main body of the Component's `render()` function.

### Example: Logging Seen State

In the below code, `useRef` is used to track whether we've handled the `onVisible` event previously. Updating `hasLoggedVisible.value` to true doesn't trigger a re-render, unlike storing and updating it via `useState`.

```kotlin
class LoggingComponent() : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val hasLoggedVisible = useRef<Boolean> { false }

    return Text(
        style =
            Style.onVisible {
              // onVisible executes on the main thread, so it's safe to use Ref here
              if (!hasLoggedVisible.value) {
                doLogVisible()
                hasLoggedVisible.value = true
              }
            },
        text = "I'll let you know when I'm visible, but only once!")
  }
}
```

### Example: Starting/Stopping Animators

In the below code, an animator is started and stopped when the Component is attached/detached on the main thread. It uses `useRef` to maintain a reference to the Animator created when the Component was attached.

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/animatedcounter/AnimatedCounter.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```

## Pairing with `useEffect`

Pairing `useRef` with `useEffect` is a common pattern. See the code samples in the [useEffect](use-effect.mdx) docs for more examples and information about `useEffect`.
