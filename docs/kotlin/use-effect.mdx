The `useEffect` hook allows a component to perform side effects when it's attached and/or detached from the tree. It corresponds to the Java Spec API's `@OnAttached`/`@OnDetached` lifecycle methods, but provides additional functionality to perform side-effects in response to changes in committed props or state.

If you haven't already, make sure to review the [Hooks Intro](hooks-intro.mdx) docs to understand more about hooks.

## Side Effects with Dependencies

:::note
`useEffect` lambdas and cleanup are both invoked on the main thread. This means it's safe to trigger animations or mutate the view hierarchy from it - however avoid expensive operations to keep the app responsive!
:::

The arguments to `useEffect` are its dependencies (e.g. props and/or state which affect the side effect performed) and a lambda to invoke when the component is attached or when those dependencies change.

```kotlin
class SubscriptionComponent(private val userId: Int, private val store: StatusStore) : KComponent() {
  override fun ComponentScope.render(): Component {
    val status = useState { Status.PENDING }
    val subscription = useRef<Subscription?> { null }

    useEffect(userId, store) {
      subscription.value = store.subscribe(userId) { newStatus -> status.update(newStatus) }
      onCleanup { store.unsubscribe(subscription.value) }
    }

    return Text(text = "$userId is ${status.value}")
  }
}
```

In the above code, when the first render is committed, Litho will invoke the `useEffect` lambda, subscribing to the current `userId`. On subsequent commits, **if `userId` changed**, Litho will invoke the cleanup callback to unsubscribe the existing subscription (if there is one) and then subscribe to the current `userId`.

In general, your dependencies should include **all** the props/state read by you useEffect/cleanup calls. If they don't, you risk incorrect behavior. For example, in the above component, if `userId` hadn't been specified, then if the component received a different `userId` as a prop, it would remain subscribed to the wrong `userId`.

### Dependency Equivalence

Dependencies are checked for equivalence by calling `equals`. If any are not equivalent, the hook will be cleaned up and called again.

### Cleanup

The return value of the lambda passed to `useEffect` is a cleanup method. In it, you should perform any cleanup necessary to undo and side-effects done in the main body of that `useEffect` call, for example canceling a subscription to a data store, or canceling an animation. If you don't have any cleanup you need to do, you can return `null` instead, i.e.:

```kotlin
useEffect {
  Toast.makeText(androidContext, "Component rendered", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
  null // return null, no cleanup necessary
}
```

## Unconditionally Triggering Side Effects

`useEffect` can also be called without dependencies. In that case on each new commit, the cleanup for the previous `useEffect` call will be invoked, followed by the current useEffect call.

## Listening to Prop/State Changes

An important functionality that `useEffect` adds over `@OnAttached`/`@OnDetached` is the ability to trigger code when props/state change. For example, this can be used to trigger an animation as a side-effect whenever some prop changes:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/animations/animatedcounter/AnimatedCounter.kt start=start_example end=end_example
```
